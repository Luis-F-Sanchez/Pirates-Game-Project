        We're building an awesome treasure hunting game! When the user clicks
        square one of three choices shows, the gold treasure space increases
        count.

      <p>
        Rlue 1: Aim for the treasures or gold squares but don't hit the bombs!
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule 2: 4 points means you win, kraken square is a "bomb". The empty
        space does basically nothing
